# CondaDEV
 A CTF2.5/MMF2 Decompiler

# What is CondaDEV?
 CondaDEV (anaCondaDEVeloper) is a fork of Anaconda Mode 4.1, with a lot of Quality of Life patches, better support and better visuals.
 CondaDEV is in highly development stage and might be very unstable.

# Support
 80% of all games are currently supported. From MMF2 to CTF2.5 Build 293. Games that are made with Clickteam Fusion 2.5+ are currently not decompileable for now. But may in the future.

# Difference
 CondaDEV is basically same with Anaconda Mode 4.1, but with a better visual and support. CondaDEV also have some patches from CTFAK in order to improve the decompile accurate!
